mvc4-jquery-file-upload-demo
============================

A working demo for using jquery file upload control in mvc4.

There are not many samples for mvc, and the ones I found were not working.

It is made with Visual Studio 2012 and uses bootstrap 3.0, jquery 2.0.3 and jquery-ui 1.10.3 which were the latest versions  as of today septembre 2013.

Hope this might help someone.
